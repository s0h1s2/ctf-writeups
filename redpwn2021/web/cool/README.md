# sql insert injection 
after i was digging on the code i found out the password is not filtered but we have a limit if password is more than 50 characters the query wouldn't be execute 
so after some try i found a way to do that.
so i made exploit.py to do the thing for me automatically
so i got the mp3 file the i downloaded and look at file content using strings command 
# flag
flag{44r0n_s4ys_s08r137y_1s_c00l}
